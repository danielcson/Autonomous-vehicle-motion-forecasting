# autonomous-vehicle-motion-forecasting




With the increase in use of autonomouse vehicles, solving the challenge of building models to reliably predict collision-free trajectories in an ever-changing and unpredictable environment is crucial before one can fully take advantage of the benefits self-driving cars bring. 

We tackled this challenge by building a deep learning motion forecasting model for autonomous vehicles. Given a five second observation of vehicle movement, the goal is to predict the trajectory a self-driving vehicle should take six seconds into the future. Various deep learning frameworks were tested, including LSTMs, RNN, and multilayer perceptons.
